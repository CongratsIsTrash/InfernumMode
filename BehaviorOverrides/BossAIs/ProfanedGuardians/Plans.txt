First Phase

The second begins when only the attacker guardian remains

Healer:

- Does not do direct contact damage
- Crystal gleams and 6 beams appear from it in an even spread and home in on targets. When a beam hits a player it
disspiates and all guardians are given a high temporary DR boost
- Fires crystal shards which home and accelerate

Defender:

- Does not do direct contact damage
- Attempts to hover near the most vulnerable guardian, acting as a meat shield
Works with the healer at times to create blasts of magically charged rocks

Attacker:
- Charges from the side over and over while releasing profaned spears
- Vulnerable until reaching 75%

Second Phase
- The attacker guardian charges energy and obtains ARMS
- Cycles through 3 attacks. Their intensity increases significantly from 75% to 25%. Once below 25% a new attack appears

Attacks:
- The attacker guardian makes its arms move inward and temporarily disappear before doing a spin charge while releasing
fire
- Teleports near the player in a flash, sits in place for a moment, and releases a barrage of flaming spears. This is
initially telegraphed with a specific sound
- Hovers to the top left/right of the player and creates barrages of light from the fingers of the arm which is closest
to the target
- Rapidly punches the player with the arms
